### Computer Vision


This repository is destined to be used in the development of the project Neuromuscular Tracking System with Ultrasound, developed in University of Aveiro, Portugal.

This project uses C++ as a programming language, taking advantage of an extensive function library used specifically for computer vision, OpenCV.

The folders are organized as follows:
```
Home Dir (eg. Aula1)
  |
  |_____ src (source files)
  |         |
  |         |_____ CMakeLists.txt
  |
  |_____ bin (binary files)
  |
  |_____ img (image files)
  |
  |_____ CMakeLists.txt
```

## Tools
* cvmake
	- Small shell script that automatically builds, compiles and cleans up projects and exercises.
	- Needs to be stored somewhere, symlinked to `/usr/bin` (eg. `ln -s ~/scripts/cvmake /usr/bin/cvmake`) and have its path added in the bash config file for it to work properly (eg. `PATH=~/scripts:$PATH`).
	- Can be executed by typing `cvmake -c` in the terminal. The argument `-c` is optional and using it cleans the excess files created during the build.
	- Extra arguments can be given and will be treated as files to be built and compiled (eg. `cvmake -c Hello` will try to search for the source file of the same name, build it and compile it, returning the binary "Hello" and finally cleaning the excess files). By using no extra arguments, the tool will build and compile the source files presented in "CMakeLists".
	- If the last argument given is `-r`, after a successful build and compilation, the script will attempt to execute the resulting binary from the first argument given, excluding `-c`.
* cvdir
	- Shell script that automatically creates directories and populates them with the needed "CMakelists" files.
	- Needs to be stored somewhere, symlinked to `/usr/bin` (eg. `ln -s ~/scripts/cvdir /usr/bin/cvdir`) and have its path added in the bash config file for it to work properly (eg. `PATH=~/scripts:$PATH`).
	- Can be executed by typing `cvdir` in the terminal followed by the directories' (that will be created) names as arguments (eg. `cvdir folder1 folder2`).

## Aula 1
* DisplayImage
    - Displays selected image in a window.

## Aula 2
* Color2Gray
	- Converts selected image to grayscale, saving it and displaying both the original and new images.
* AddImages
	- Adds two images with the same pixel size to output a new image. Needs the input of the alpha of the first image.
* ChangeBrigtCront
	- Reads and image, takes alpha and beta as input values for levels of brightness and constrast and outputs new image with those levels modified.
	- Reads images from computer camera feed.

## Aula 3
* VideoCapture
	- Reads images from computer camera feed, outputting them sequentially to form a video feed.
	- Manipulates the video frames, displaying them as a grayscale image or as a black & white image, with several options of thresholding.
* DetectSkin
	- Outputs computer camera information as a video feed.
	- Converts video output into several colorspaces (selected by the user), followed by extracting the pixels of the image that fall within a certain range, with the intent of finding objects with the color of skin.
	- Superimposes the pixels found with the previous method on the original video feed.
* ImageFilter
	- Filters a video feed with several filters, chosen by the user.
* GetHist
	- Reads an image from the computer camera feed and analyzes it, displaying its histograms.
	- Capable of displaying BGR histograms, grayscale histogram, or both at the same time, for comparison.

## Aula 4
* CalcGrad
	- Read video filter, applying one of several gradient calculators, displaying the result.
	- The gradient calculator are based in the first or second image derivatives.
* Canny
	- Uses the Canny's algorythm to detect edges of a video feed.
* CornerDetect
	- Uses the Harris' algorythm to detect corners on an image provided by a camera.
* HoughCircle
	- Detects circles in a provided image, using the Hough Circle Transform.
	- Detected circles are displayed in red, with its centers in green.
* HoughLine
	- Detects lines in a provided image, using the Hough Line Transform.
	- Detected lines are displayed in red.
* Contours
	- Alternative method to find lines and circles in a provided image.

## Aula 5
* CameraCalib
	- Calibrates camera, using images or a video feed containing a chessboard pattern.
	- Stores calibration information in an external XML file called "camParams.xml".

## Aula 6
* StereoCalib
	- Calibrates a stereo camera system, using images from each camera which contain chessboard patterns.
	- Stores calibration data in external XML files.
* Undistort
	- Given calibration data from stereo cameras, undistorts the distortion created by the camera lenses.
	- Displays epipolar lines in the undistorted output images at a point defined by the user (by mouse click).
* Rectify
	- Given calibration data from stereo cameras, undistorts and then rectifies the image output.
	- Displays an horizontal line in the output images for comparison, at a point defined by the user (by mouse click).

## Aula 7 e 8
* WriteToPCD
	- Writes a random cloud to a PCD file.
* Reconstruct
	- Reconstructs the 3D coordinates of a scene contained in an image, using the rectified images taken from a stereo camera system as starting point.
* ViewCloud
	- Displays a points cloud.
* ViewOpenNI
	- Displays feed from an OpenNI compatible system.
	- Saves points cloud from feed to PCD file.
* ICPAlign
	- Takes two clouds from the same scene and aligns them, creating a third, aligned, cloud.

## Aula 9
* OpticalFlow
	- Tracks movement by means of optical flow.
	- Displays movement as difference in a point position between frames (as a line).
* BackForegSep
	- Tracks movement by means of background subtraction.
	- Displays the difference between the background and new frames. Objects that moved between frames are displayed as white.
* ObjTracking
	- Tracks selected objects, by means of a ROI (region of interest), using the CamShift/MeanShift algorythm.
	- Uses color as a basis for object identification.

## Aula 10
* TempMatch
	- Attempts to match templates to features in an image or video file.
	- Slow but more robust than simple matching, because it checks for scale.
* FaceDetect
	- Detects faces and eyes in an image.
